*A Memory Systems Meetup recap under Chatham House rules*

What happens after the honeymoon period with spaced repetition ends?

This call circled around that question: what to do with bad cards, stale decks, life bottlenecks, shifting priorities, and the uneasy feeling that if something isn’t in Anki, it will vanish from our minds forever. Along the way, people shared very concrete tactics for “wisdom decks,” social-skill cards, integrative flashcards, quote collections, and more.

Below is an anonymized summary of the themes, ideas, and experiments that surfaced.

## 1. Everyone starts with bad cards

One participant opened by confessing that they’re only a couple of months into serious SRS use—and already sitting on a graveyard of discarded cards. Their early mistakes were extremely familiar:

- **Cards that were too effortful.** Long answers, vague prompts, and questions that required reconstructing half a lecture to answer.
- **Too many cards.** Turning every interesting sentence into a flashcard and then drowning under the review load.
- **Overloaded clozes.** A single note with 5–7 cloze deletions that, in practice, behaved like a small swarm of mediocre cards instead of a focused set of prompts.
- **Unnatural prompts, especially for math.** Cards were built around the name of a concept or transformation, even though real-life prompts are usually visual or structural (“I see this side of the equation, what comes next?”).

A long-time practitioner pointed out something uncomfortable: many of the cards we think are “good” only feel that way because we wrote them by hand. Writing them creates deep encoding, so early reviews feel smooth. Cards written by AI lack that initial encoding, so they feel worse—even when the underlying card quality is comparable. Over time, both AI-generated and hand-written cards go through the same cycle: some become workhorses, most get deleted.

The shared takeaway: making bad cards (and throwing them away) isn’t a bug of SRS—it’s a permanent feature of the practice.

## 2. When to delete a card

A recurring question was: When do you actually throw a card away?

A veteran user framed it this way: a single memory is not worth minutes of frustration and a persistent drag on your emotional experience of reviews. Some personal rules of thumb that came up:

- **Frequent lapses after honest fixes → delete.** If you’ve rephrased, split, or simplified a card and it’s still failing, it’s probably not worth the cost.
- **“Ugh, this again” is a red flag.** The moment a card reliably triggers dread, you’ve turned a learning tool into a daily micro-punishment.
- **No clear reason to remember it.** Sometimes you look at a card and realize you can’t articulate why you ever cared about that fact. That’s usually a good time to let it go.
- **Over-collecting is inevitable.** People drawn to SRS tend to want to “know everything.” That leads to memorizing enzyme names, obscure definitions, or details that don’t meaningfully change your life or work.

One attendee described using tooling to search for related cards: before deleting, they check, “Does this hang together with a larger structure?” If it clearly fits into a well-used cluster, they might rewrite it. If not, it’s likely expendable.

Behind all of this is a deeper mindset shift: forgetting is allowed. The goal is not to turn your brain into an index of everything you ever touched; it’s to keep the small subset that genuinely matters.

## 3. SRS as a force multiplier for real life, not just trivia

One participant noticed that getting serious about “what deserves a card” forced them to confront their actual bottlenecks in life:

- Avoiding big financial mistakes
- Improving their dating life and social courage
- Becoming more consistently grateful and stable in mood

They started building a “wisdom deck”—cards about principles, mindsets, and behaviors that address those bottlenecks. The key twist:

**They don’t grade the card based on whether they remembered the text—they grade it based on whether they embodied it that day.**

If a card says something like “Approach people despite irrational social fear,” they mark it as “remembered” only if their behavior matched that idea on the day of review. If not, it’s “forgotten,” even if they could parrot the sentence perfectly.

This shifts SRS from a tool for recall to a tool for alignment:

- Hard-to-embody behaviors stay in closer rotation.
- “Easy virtues” drift further out, because they’re already habitual.
- Cards act as a daily mirror rather than a pop quiz.

Others echoed this with similar “life cards”: practical investing principles, reminders about gratitude, social habits, and interpersonal courage. These decks were often described as some of the highest-leverage cards people had ever made.

## 4. Replaying mistakes—and wins

Another attendee uses SRS for post-mortems on social and professional situations. Whenever they handle something poorly—a meeting, a conversation, a negotiation—they create cards that:

- Ask them to replay the situation in detail, or
- Visualize an alternate version where they notice a cue earlier, respond differently, or choose a better option.

The back of the card is often empty; the “answer” is the visualization itself. Review becomes a structured mental rehearsal, similar to how climbers visualize a route before actually climbing it.

To avoid turning their deck into a museum of failures, they pair this with cards about good decisions and wins—a technique inspired by a well-known researcher who keeps cards on “good choices” to revisit over time. The idea is to:

- Extract more value from mistakes and
- Keep your internal narrative from skewing purely negative.

## 5. Atomic vs integrative cards

The group also spent time on how to handle abstract concepts (math, philosophy, history, business) and grading them well.

A few shared perspectives:

**Atomic cards** (one clear fact, relationship, or mini-step) are crucial for accurate grading:
- “I either recalled this or I didn’t.”
- If a card contains 3–4 ideas, partial recall makes grading fuzzy.

But you also need **integrative cards**—prompts that require putting several atomic pieces together:
- Recalling a 3-item list
- Explaining a process end-to-end
- Situating events within a historical timeline
- Naming all layers of a computer networking model

People noted that current schedulers aren’t “content-aware”: if you miss only the 3rd item in a 3-item list, the tool can’t automatically shorten the interval for just that one atomic fact. In a perfect world, failing the integrative card would automatically “ping” the specific underlying atom you missed. We’re not there yet, but thinking this way helps clarify card design.

One practical pattern:
1. Build atomic cards first (each item or concept on its own).
2. Then add integrative prompts that ask you to recall the full structure or story.
3. Grade integrative cards harshly (“any small detail wrong = again”), while letting the atomic cards handle the fine-grained spacing.

## 6. Quotes as portable mental furniture

Toward the end of the call, the conversation turned to memorizing quotes—not just as aesthetic ornaments, but as compact carriers of insight.

One participant has been reading historical autobiographies in the original language and noticed how often their subjects leaned on memorized quotations (often Latin) as a decision-making toolkit and a kind of moral and intellectual scaffolding.

Their current approach:
- Use cloze deletions to break quotes into segments.
- Build both segment-level cards and integrative cards for the full quotation.
- Experiment with different prompts (context, author, situation) to see which handles actually bring the quote to mind in daily life.

The sense in the room was that quotes operate on both conscious and unconscious levels, slowly shaping intuitions and “gut feel” over time.

## 7. Changing life priorities and stale decks

A recurring pain point: what happens when your life changes, but your deck still thinks you’re a full-time student?

One attendee described shifting from “student mode” (linear algebra, computer networking, formal courses) into “trying to build a software business.” Their backlog was full of cards from old priorities, and they found themselves skipping reviews, lowering daily limits, and feeling guilty that SRS “wasn’t exciting anymore.”

Another person told the story of working on their own spaced-repetition app while still in university. At some point, they had days with 120 math cards due—material they weren’t using in their new full-stack/product role. The solution: they bulk-suspended all math cards without even triaging them.

Four years later, they’ve returned to machine learning and are relearning some fundamentals. They don’t regret the mass suspension at all: it prevented four years of heavy daily review for knowledge they might never have needed. Creating fresh cards now is a small price to pay for that freedom.

A few mental models that emerged:
- **SRS is a hobby, not a job.** If you stopped reviewing entirely, the main consequence is “I’d know fewer things I’m interested in,” not “my life collapses.”
- **Cards can and maybe should have a “death date.”** Borrowing from some language-learning practitioners: past a certain interval (a year, two years), old cards can auto-delete or auto-suspend. If the information is truly important, reality will re-introduce it through your work, reading, or conversations.
- **The real goal is to get over the “natural exposure threshold.”** Once a word, concept, or pattern is familiar enough, ongoing exposure in the wild can maintain it; SRS is there to push you over that hump, not carry you forever.

## 8. Experiments you might steal

Here’s a quick menu of experiments people on the call are currently running:

**Behavior-graded wisdom cards**
- Prompt: a principle or behavior you care about.
- Grade: “Did I live this today?” rather than “Could I recite it?”

**Post-mortem visualization cards**
- Prompt: “Replay scenario X. How would Future-You handle it?”
- Use these for social slip-ups, work mistakes, or moments that felt off.

**Positive “good decisions” cards**
- Capture times you acted well or chose wisely to counterbalance the mistake-focused cards.

**Bulk-suspend by domain when priorities change**
- If a whole area (e.g., university math) stops being relevant, suspend the entire deck instead of dragging it along for years.

**Atomic + integrative layering**
- Build small, sharp atomic cards.
- Add integrative prompts that pull several atoms together into a story, model, or list.

**Quote decks**
- Use clozes to chunk quotes.
- Test different prompts (author, context, situation) to find the handles that matter for you.

None of these are “official best practices.” They’re live experiments from people trying to make spaced repetition serve their actual lives rather than the other way around.

### Closing thought

If there was a quiet through-line in the conversation, it was this:

> Spaced repetition is powerful, but it’s not sacred. The point is not to save every fact—it’s to build a life you actually want, with a mind that’s stocked with the right kinds of things.

The art, then, is less about perfect schedulers and more about taste: knowing what to remember, what to forget, and when to let a card die so something better can take its place.
