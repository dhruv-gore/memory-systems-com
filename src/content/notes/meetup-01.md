## Summary

We discussed the potential of using Augmented Reality (AR) to instantiate the "Method of Loci" in physical space.

### Key Points

1. **Spatial Anchoring:** Current AR glasses have sufficient SLAM capabilities to persist virtual objects in real-world locations.
2. **Cognitive Load:** Does offloading memory to space reduce or increase the cognitive load of retrieval?
3. **Shared Palaces:** The social implications of shared memory spaces.

### Next Steps

* Prototype a simple Unity app for placing "memory tokens" in a room.
* Read "The Art of Memory" by Frances Yates for next week.
